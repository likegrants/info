## How to apply

### Eligibility

* All applicants are required to have a LikeCoin Wallet and a Matters user account.
* All projects are strongly preferred to be open-sourced by default; if not, the reasons must be clearly specified in the proposal.
* All applicants (either a person or a team) must be self-managed. The program offers only the grant and necessary consultations.

### Timing & Review Process

* The program is open for application continuously for 12 months starting from **May, 2021**, or until the fund is used up. Applications will be grouped in the same round every two months. 
* An application is only valid after each step of the proposal submission (see below) is fully completed. 
* Proposals successfully submitted will be introduced to the community space on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/W4DQ6peZZZ) to collect public opinions, before the committee gets to review them formally.
* Proposals will be reviewed on a rolling basis. Which is to say: the committee may decide to accept or reject your application as well as suggest a proposal revision before each round ends.
* At the same round, a proposal (including a revised version) will be qualified to be reviewed 2 times at most. The review for further revision will be held off until the next round. The review committee will have the discretion to relax this requirement.
* Under normal circumstances, the applicants will recieve a final decision or a status notification no later than 10 days after the closing date of each round.

### Submit a Proposal

1. Check out the [template-en.md](https://github.com/likegrants/proposals/blob/main/template-en.md) file in the [proposals](https://github.com/likegrants/proposals) repo. 
2. Submit a PR against the template file. Make sure to: (1) fill in all the categories in either English, Chinese, or both; (2) rename your file `project-title`.md (don't forget to replace `project-title` with the name of your project).
3. Go to [Matters](https://matters.news) website and publish a post (ideally contains a decent summary of your proposal) with the link of your GitHub submission included. This will help more LikeCoin general users to learn about your project in advance, and you can earn additional LikeCoin from your article. Make sure the Matters ID used is linked to the same LikeCoin wallet you wish to receive the grant.
4. Send an email to like.grants@protonmail.com with a subject titled "LikeCoin Grants Proposal: `Your Project Title`" and in it please indicate: (1) your LikeCoin Wallet address or Liker ID; (2) the link of your GitHub submission; (3) the link of your Matters post.
5. Be patient. Wait for a confirmation email from the program.

## Acceptance of Grant & Obligations

* If your application is accpeted, the program will contact you for follow-ups, such as to confirm the grant period, the funding milestones, etc. 
* By default, the grant is meant to be delivered in installments. Terms and conditions will be proposed by the program through discussion with the grantee. 
* When the grant period is close to end, the grantee is required to give an outcome demonstration/presentation through a demo-day-like event or a similar arrangement (mostly online events) hosted by the program.
* Before the last installment of the grant is made, the grantee is obliged to turn in a simple final account that indicates how the grant has actually been used based on the budget planned.


## Bonus Grant for Outstanding Projects
* To encourage the grantees to use the budget actively, properly and sufficiently, as well as to pursue the best achievement possible for your project, the program also includes a review mechanism for giving out bonus grant. 
* Before the end of the grant period, the committee will evaluate the outcome of your project. Based on the evaluation, the program will have the discretion to give a bonus ranging from 1% to 10% of the orignal grant to the grantee.
