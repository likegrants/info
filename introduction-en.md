## How to apply

### Eligibility

* All projects are strongly preferred to be open-sourced by default; if not, the reasons must be clearly specified in the proposal.
* All applicants (ether a person or a team) must be self-managed. The program offers only the grant and necessary consultations.

### Timing & Review Process

* Starting from **May, 2021**, in the following 12 months or until the fund is used up, the program will open for application continuously. In every 2 months the applications will be grouped as in a round. 
* An application is only valid after each step of the proposal submission (see below) is fully completed. 
* Proposals successfully submitted will be introduced to the community space on Discord to collect public opinions, before the committee gets to review them formally.
* Proposals will be reviewed on a rolling basis. Which is to say: the committee may decide to accept or reject your application as well as suggest a proposal revision before each round ends.
* At the same round, a proposal (including a revised version) is qualified to be reviewed 2 times at most. For further revisions, if submitted, the review will be held off to the next round.
* Under normal circumstances, the applicants will recieve a final decision or a status notification no later than 10 days after the closing date of each round.
